Puzzle steps:

1. Hunters start out by going to the index page and seeing a glyph similar to the warmind dlc logo with 4 symbols. each symbol is am emblem of a specific page
   - rasputin logo
   - engram
   - traveler
   - rat
(these can be solved in any order)
2. Hunters go through the puzzle steps in any order
    1. ratking.html is solved by going to the page and reading the inscryption it's something like "-- --- small, --- --- are legion" in barcode lang
    2. rasputin.html links to a .zip file
        - from there, hunters rename the .zip file to a .png
        - in the png there are extra bits, spelling out "the key is 'perserverance'"
    3. engram.html
    4. traveler.html
3. once each hint is decoded, the barcode message on index.html can be decoded. it reads:
   > contemplate this broken thought
   > in a place out of time
   > lies an agent of nine
   > but who does he serve?
4. xur is the agent, and in the map _eternity_ he serves "starhorse"
5. on "starhorse.html" is a black hole in the background looping with a message above
    > you've traveled far little light
    > and we're impressed
    > we hope you join us to chat with the creator of this world
    > and maybe, if you show up with, our presence will be known
